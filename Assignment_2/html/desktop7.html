                <h1 class="story-title">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</h1>
                <p>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is the final installment in J.K. Rowling's series, chronicling Harry Potter's ultimate battle against Lord Voldemort. The story is filled with danger, loss, and courage as Harry and his friends face their greatest challenge yet.</p> 

                <h2>The Rise of Darkness</h2>
                <p>The novel begins with Voldemort's regime taking control of the Ministry of Magic, Hogwarts, and the wizarding world. Muggle-born witches and wizards are persecuted, and Voldemort's Death Eaters spread fear everywhere. Harry, now 17, is declared "Undesirable No. 1."</p>
                <p>The Order of the Phoenix attempts to safely move Harry from Privet Drive. During the mission, they are ambushed by Death Eaters, resulting in the death of Mad-Eye Moody and the injury of George Weasley.</p>

                <h2>The Horcrux Hunt Begins</h2>
                <p>Harry, Ron, and Hermione go on a mission to find and destroy Voldemort's Horcruxes. These objects contain fragments of Voldemort's soul, making him nearly immortal. They retrieve a locket from Dolores Umbridge in the Ministry of Magic, but are forced to flee.</p>
                <p>The locket Horcrux negatively affects them, causing arguments and despair. Ron, influenced by the Horcrux, leaves in anger, but eventually returns, saving Harry's life and destroying the locket with the Sword of Gryffindor.</p>

                <h2>The Tale of the Deathly Hallows</h2>
                <div class="hallows-list">
                    <p>The trio learns about the Deathly Hallows:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Elder Wand - the most powerful wand</li>
                        <li>The Resurrection Stone - brings back echoes of the dead</li>
                        <li>The Invisibility Cloak - perfect concealment</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>Harry realizes he already owns the Cloak and that Voldemort is seeking the Elder Wand to become invincible.</p>

                <h2>The Return to Hogwarts</h2>
                <p>The trio returns to Hogwarts to find the last Horcrux. With help from their friends, they discover it is Ravenclaw's diadem, hidden in the Room of Requirement. As they fight to destroy it, Voldemort attacks the school.</p>
                <p>In the chaos, beloved characters, including Fred Weasley, Remus Lupin, and Nymphadora Tonks, are killed.</p>

                <h2>Harry's Sacrifice</h2>
                <p>Harry learns that he himself is a Horcrux—Voldemort unintentionally embedded a fragment of his soul in Harry. He willingly goes to Voldemort, who casts the Killing Curse. Harry awakens in a limbo-like state and meets Dumbledore, who explains that Voldemort has just destroyed the Horcrux within Harry.</p>
                <p>Harry returns to the battle.</p>

                <h2>The Final Duel</h2>
                <p>Voldemort uses the Elder Wand against Harry. But since Harry is the true master of the Elder Wand (he had disarmed Draco Malfoy, who disarmed Dumbledore), the wand refuses to harm him. The Killing Curse rebounds on Voldemort, destroying him for good.</p>

                <h2>After the Battle</h2>
                <p>The wizarding world is finally free. Harry chooses to return the Elder Wand to Dumbledore's tomb, ensuring no one can use its power again.</p>

                <h2>Epilogue (19 Years Later)</h2>
                <p>Nineteen years later, Harry, Ginny, Ron, and Hermione are at King's Cross Station, sending their children to Hogwarts. Harry's scar has not hurt since Voldemort's defeat, signaling that peace has been restored.</p><br><br>

                <h2>Themes</h2>
